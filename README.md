# bf19 interpreter

This is an interpreter for [bf19](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B%2B), an esoteric programming language created by CosmicMan08#1975, written in Rust. bf19 was designed to be really terrible, and to continue with this theme (and definitely not because I am too lazy to test the things I make), this interpreter is also very terrible. Enjoy!

## usage
Run the program and enter your bf19 code on the first line of stdin
